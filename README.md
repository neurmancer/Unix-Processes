# Unix-Processes 

- **This repo is for learning fork() and processes for improve ShittyJukebox project and all the lecture(ish) shit will be in here**

## Lectures
- Added 1.c, about fork() (Introduction)
- Added 2.c, about wait() (Introduction)
- Added 3.c, still about wait(but now I partially know what the NULL thingy is)
- Added 4.c, about pipe() (it was cool, felt like cyber-sorcery)
- Added 5.c, using pipe() to split work between processes (R.I.P my Ryzen5 2600X from 2018)


## Examples 
- This part is fuck around and find out zone(probably will have a forkbomb for fun too)


## STATS

- **Encountered zombies** : 0
